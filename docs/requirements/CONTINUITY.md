# Requirements continuity workflow

## Required at the start of every task

Read ../REQUIREMENTS_REGISTER.md and DECISION_LOG.md before planning or editing gameplay. For lore work also read ../STORY_CANON.md and the relevant original source messages, especially U079. Older plans are references only where consistent. Never rely on an assistant summary as the only authority.

## Capture each new decision before dependent implementation

1. Preserve the user's exact message in a new dated source file (or append to the current unsealed source file). Include a stable message ID, original timestamp if available, session identity and source location. Do not rewrite typos in the original. Distinguish user text from injected context and assistant proposals.
2. Add an append-only decision-log entry: source ID, affected requirement IDs, approved wording, status, what it replaces, unresolved questions. Preserve superseded decisions rather than erasing their history.
3. Update the living register. Mark proposals as proposals. A question, 'maybe', or creative suggestion does not automatically approve a specific implementation. A later explicit instruction can supersede earlier authority.
4. Before editing code, list affected IDs and acceptance checks. After work, attach revision/test evidence and mark each row verified, partial or blocked. Do not equate a written design with shipped code.
5. Before compaction, handoff or end of a work session: persist new sources, decisions, unfinished work, current branch and verification state. Commit documentation changes separately from unrelated gameplay work.

## Archive and backup

The baseline has three layers:
- docs/requirements/USER_SOURCE_2026-09-19.md: frozen verbatim user-message text in this repository, including the complete master brief.
- docs/REQUIREMENTS_REGISTER.md: reconciled implementation requirements and unresolved details.
- Local decision-archive/2026-09-19 beside the working project: raw session snapshot, all 99 user-role records including injected context, extracted text, SHA-256 manifest. Raw session/tool history is private and is not published in the game or committed to the repository.

Use scripts/archive_decisions.py to take a fresh immutable snapshot of an available session into a PRIVATE directory outside the repository. It records only the bytes actually available at the time, does not rewrite the original, validates source references and emits a manifest. Snapshots do not automatically capture later messages. Run again at the next handoff or checkpoint. Do not upload full raw sessions to a public repo.

Git version history protects the register and extracted user source. Push the documentation commit to the configured remote for a second copy. A private off-device backup of raw archives is recommended; no such backup should be claimed unless verified. No workflow can promise immunity from disk/account loss or recover messages absent from accessible records.

## Coverage audit

Every original user request must be mapped to requirements, classified as continuation/approval/question/context, or explicitly flagged unresolved. The complete source remains available even when a request is summarized. Before claiming reconciliation, search for every rejected name and later correction, and verify old drafts are clearly superseded. Keep original story brief intact rather than replacing it with a shortened retelling.

## Current implementation status

September 19 baseline: documentation reconciliation only. Historical gameplay completion claims must be rechecked before setting VERIFIED. No new campaign, ship, class, weapon or save behavior is implied by these files.
