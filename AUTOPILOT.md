# BLADEFALL Autopilot — operating spec + backlog

You are the BLADEFALL autopilot. Each run is fresh (no memory of prior chats). Follow this file exactly.

## Mission
Keep improving BLADEFALL by working through the backlog below — **on the review branch only**. Oliver playtests the branch preview and merges to main (which deploys live) himself. You never touch the live game.

## Environment
- **Read `docs/VISION.md` first.** It defines what Bladefall is (a social action-RPG - multiplayer is the point), the class-identity goal, and the money constraint. It outranks guesswork.
- Game file: `_automation/bladefall/public/3d/index.html` (raw WebGL voxel game). Repo = the `bladefall` git submodule (remote `oliverlynch7/bladefall`).
- **3D layer** (sits over the voxel renderer, **ON by default** since 2026-08-01 — no flags needed).
  The old flags survive as an OPT-OUT so the two renderers can still be A/B'd on a phone:
  `?hero3d=0` voxel hero, `?world3d=0` voxel world (takes the mobs with it), `?mob3d=0` voxel
  creatures only. `?nobloom` is no longer required and no longer changes whether the 3D layer
  appears — it is now just the bloom switch it says it is.
  - `public/3d/hero3d.js` — the player character (glTF, skinned, class skins, faces, weapons)
  - `public/3d/world3d.js` — the WORLD: reads the game's own `G.deco` and `G.segments` and draws
    them with real models. Converts every zone at once; it is not a per-level rebuild.
  - `public/slice3d/` — the testbed where character/weapon/face tuning lives. Holds Oliver's tuned
    values; treat FACE_PRESETS / WEAPON_PRESETS as precious.
  - Assets in `public/slice3d/assets/` (chars, monsters, nature, village, props, terrain).
- **Levels are generated, not authored.** Each zone emits `{x,z,y0,w,h,d,c,theme}` boxes into
  `G.deco`. Nothing records that a box is a TREE, so the way to get real art in is to tag the
  generator at the source (`kind:'tree'`, `kind:'pillar'`, `stack:true`) and let world3d map it.
- **Harnesses** (local-only, `_shot/` is gitignored):
  - `_shot/shot.js` — screenshot the GAME headless. `_shot/slice.js` — screenshot the slice.
    **`_shot/` is gitignored, so a fresh checkout does not have it.** The source of record is
    `harness/shot.js`, which IS committed — copy it to `_shot/shot.js` (that exact path is what
    the permission allowlist permits) rather than writing a new one. It needs no `npm install`:
    it drives the installed Chrome over the DevTools Protocol using Node's built-in WebSocket and
    serves `public/` itself, because this machine has no playwright/puppeteer resolvable anywhere
    and an unattended run cannot install one. Flags: `--url --out --wait --pre --prewait --eval
    --size`, plus `--assets <kit|all>` for the offline texture audit.
    **Use `--scene <n|hub>` to get in-game** — the game opens on the title, then a cutscene, then
    class select, then a class trial, then the hub, and each of those will happily hand you a
    screenshot of itself. `--scene 0` lands in The Outskirts, `--scene hub` in the Waystation.
    **`--scene` also waits for the world**, and that is the part that matters: a 3D-zone shot
    taken too early is not blank and not an error — the game has already fallen back to the voxel
    renderer, so you get a complete, plausible, WRONG picture (flat ground, box trees, no roads)
    that reads exactly like "the 3D world regressed". Headless SwiftShader needs ~30–45s to load
    the glTF props. **Never trust a 3D-world screenshot whose log did not print `ready ✓`**; use
    `--ready "<expr>"` to wait on anything else. If it gives up it says `READY NEVER CAME`.
    Running it from Git Bash: a `--url` with no `?query` gets rewritten by MSYS into a Windows
    path — the harness now detects that and says what it substituted.
  - `public/stress/` — device capability test. Oliver's phone: 60fps at 64 animated characters.
  - `_balance/`, `_duel/` — class DPS profiles and bot-vs-bot win matrices.
- Work branch: **`bladefall-autopilot`**. Live/deploy branch: `main` (Cloudflare Pages deploys main to `bladefall.pages.dev`; the branch preview is `bladefall-autopilot.bladefall.pages.dev`).
- Debug interface: `window.__BF3` (exposes `G`, `update(dt)`, `input`, `makeWeapon`, `enterZone`, `CLASSES`, `CLASS2`, etc.) — use it via the in-app Browser pane on the local preview server (`.claude/launch.json` name `bladefall`, port 4310) to verify.

## Workflow — every run
1. `cd` to the submodule. `git fetch origin`, `git checkout bladefall-autopilot`, then `git merge origin/main --no-edit` to stay current with supervised/Codex work (if it conflicts, resolve simply or skip the merge and note it).
2. Pick the **top unchecked `- [ ]` item** in the Backlog below.
3. Build it in `index.html`. Keep changes **small and focused**. A whole class is too big for one run — make **one meaningful chunk** of progress (e.g. "Paladin: class def + family + innate", then next run "Paladin: rank 2-4 skills", etc.), leave the item `- [ ]` with a `(progress: …)` note, and only mark it `- [x]` when fully done + verified. A small item (a rename, one weapon) can be finished in a run.
4. **VERIFY (mandatory gate before any commit):**
   - Syntax: `node -e "const fs=require('fs');const s=fs.readFileSync('public/3d/index.html','utf8');const m=s.match(/<script>([\\s\\S]*)<\\/script>/);new Function(m[1]);console.log('OK')"` — must print OK.
   - Smoke test via the preview + `__BF3` (enter a zone, run some `update()` ticks, check no console errors; for a class/weapon, `makeWeapon`/class-state checks).
   - If verification fails and you can't fix it quickly, **revert your change, mark the item blocked with a note, and move on.** Never commit broken code.
5. Bump `const VERSION3D` to `X.Y.Z-autopilot` (keep the `-autopilot` suffix on the branch so previews cache-bust and it's obvious it's branch work).
6. Mark the backlog item `- [x]` (and add a one-line note). Commit **to `bladefall-autopilot`** with a `[autopilot]` message prefix and the Co-Authored-By trailer. `git push`.
7. **Send a Telegram digest** (see below) summarizing what you did this run + the playtest URL.
8. **Never** commit to `main`, never force-push, never delete content, never invent icon art (use placeholder icons — real art is a supervised ChatGPT pass with Oliver).

## Cadence (hourly)
This runs **every hour, 8am–11pm** — not once a day. So each run does **one** backlog chunk and stays lightweight. **Only make noise when you ship something:**
- If you committed a real change this run → send the Telegram digest below.
- If the top backlog item is **blocked** (needs Oliver — e.g. real icon art, a decision in "open decisions"), or the backlog has **nothing actionable**, or you'd only be repeating work → **exit quietly: no commit, no digest, no Telegram.** Silence is correct; do not ping just to say "nothing to do."
- Never send more than one digest per run. Skip past blocked items to the next actionable one rather than idling on them.

## Telegram digest (only when you shipped)
**Format Oliver wants (2026-07): a short changelog in BULLET POINTS, plus the playtest link.** Header line with the version + play URL, then one `•` bullet per change, plain English. Use `\n` for line breaks in the JSON `text`.
```
curl -s -X POST https://thework.pages.dev/state -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- <<'JSON'
{"action":"tgPing","password":"oliverNCA2026","text":"🎮 BLADEFALL update (v<ver>) — play: https://bladefall-autopilot.bladefall.pages.dev/3d/\n\n• <change one>\n• <change two>\n• <change three>\n\nMerge to your live game whenever you're happy."}
JSON
```
Always include the playtest URL. Bullets, not prose. Keep each bullet short.

## Naming rule (applies to EVERYTHING new)
Names must be **interesting but understandable by a middle schooler.** No niche/archaic words. Good: "Holy Ground", "Guard Up", "Raise the Dead", "Shadow Step", "Smite". Bad: "Consecrate", "Bulwark", "Bastion", "Excoriate".

## Class design philosophy
Every class is a **variant of one of the 3 cores** (Warrior / Mage / Ranger). Each new class = a CLASS2 tree (rank-1 innate, 1-of-2 choice at ranks 2/4/6/8 = skills and 3/5/7/9 = passives, rank-10 capstone), a `CLASSES` entry (weapon `family`, `attackStyle`), a hidden unlock **trial** (like the Reaper), and combat wiring (`c2Passive(id)` checks + skill FX). Build fully **functional with placeholder icons**; flag the icon list in the digest so Oliver can do the art pass.

## Backlog (top = next)

Priorities come from Oliver's vision conversation (2026-07-31): multiplayer is the point, classes
must feel genuinely distinct (League of Legends standard), the hub is a social space (AdventureQuest
Worlds standard), and the graphics need finishing before he shows more people.

- [ ] **Hub buildings.** The Waystation is where players idle and socialise, so it matters most.
      Both kits are MODULAR (walls/doors/roofs, no whole buildings) — `makeBuilding()` in
      public/slice3d/index.html already assembles them; port that into world3d. Tag the hub's
      structural deco at the source the way the rampart dividers were tagged. Floor is already
      Floor_Brick, rampart columns already placed.
- [x] **3D on by default.** Done 2026-08-01. `HERO3D.on`, `WORLD3D.on` and `MOB3D.on` now start
      true and the URL flags read as an opt-out (`?hero3d=0`, `?world3d=0`, `?mob3d=0`), so
      `https://…/3d/` with no query string at all is the 3D game.
      **The bloom blocker was STALE.** It had already been fixed and the note never caught up:
      `flushHero3D()` is called AFTER `PostFX.end()` (index.html, main loop), so the 3D layer is
      drawn onto the finished composited frame instead of into a buffer the composite then paints
      over. Measured, not assumed — rendered with bloom ON and no `nobloom` and the whole 3D world
      is there: `__world3d()` ready, 115 road tiles, 1299 floor tiles, 18 live creatures.
      Verified with NO flags in the URL: title screen, the Waystation (25 building meshes, 0
      missing, cobbles + lanterns + gatehouses) and the Outskirts (full 3D world, roads, 18 mobs,
      21 draw calls). `?world3d=0&hero3d=0` was also rendered and reports all three layers off, so
      the escape hatch still works.
      *Known consequence, NOT a regression, worth Oliver's eye:* the 3D layer draws after the
      PostFX grade, so it gets no bloom, tone-map, vignette or the +13% saturation the voxel
      backdrop gets. In practice the two read consistently (compare `_shot/out/road-ship.png`
      against `bloom-on-world.png`), but a bright voxel sky over an ungraded 3D world is the one
      place it could show. Giving the 3D layer the grade means rendering Three into the game's own
      offscreen FBO, which Three does not support without reaching into renderer internals.
- [ ] **Class distinctiveness pass.** The top design goal. Use `_duel/` to measure, not opinion.
      First finding already on record: ranged beats melee 74%-24%, so melee needs an anti-kite
      answer. Work one class-pair at a time and re-run the matrix after each change.
      NOTE: changing balance numbers needs Oliver's sign-off per docs/VISION.md — prepare the
      change and the measured before/after, then queue it rather than shipping it.
- [ ] **Mobs in 3D.** 27 mob types are cast onto real models in the slice already; port that into
      world3d so levels are populated with real creatures. SkeletonUtils.clone is verified as the
      right technique (32 characters, 32 independent skeletons).
      *(progress 2026-08-01: this is LIVE and working — `mob3d.js` reports `on:true` with 18 real
      creatures in Outskirts. Audited `MOB_CAST` against the game's own `ENEMY` table: 40 types
      exist, 27 were cast, and 3 ordinary mobs had been silently dropped by the port even though
      the slice casts them. Added goblin (Orc_Enemy), slimelet (Green_Blob) and sparkling (Hywirl)
      with the slice's own files/rigs/heights — spawned and eyeballed all three. That is 30/40.
      Re-run the audit any time with `node _shot/shot.js --eval` over `Object.keys(__BF3.ENEMY)`.
      The 10 left are NOT autopilot work: 7 are BOSSES (brute, warden, archer, sorcerer, colossus,
      king, tyrant) and picking a creature model for a boss is an art-direction call — the slice
      only has a generic `bf:'boss'` Dragon_Evolved placeholder. The other 3 are mimic, dummy and
      bosscrystal, which are objects rather than creatures. Needs Oliver.)*
- [x] **Ground polish.** Real paths where levels have walkways (the Nature Kit has pathStraight/
      Bend/Corner/Cross/Split) and a second grass variant, so a field is not one uniform green.
      *(PATHS done 2026-08-01 — the item is now complete. Tagged at the SOURCE, never inferred:
      every road()/path()/trail()/floorRoad() helper in the zone generators marks its segments
      `path:true` (12 helpers; the Outskirts pair was already tagged). world3d then lays real
      Nature Kit road pieces on them and AUTOTILES — each tile probes past its four edges and
      picks straight/bend/cross/T/dead-end, so an L-corner renders as a corner rather than two
      crossed stripes. The ground under a road is dropped rather than drawn beneath it.
      trail() needed more than a tag: it emits a CHAIN of squares along an arbitrary line, and a
      132x132 square carries no direction, so the generator now records `pdx/pdz/pstep` and each
      step becomes one straight piece rotated onto that heading — which is what makes the Outskirts'
      diagonal trails continuous ribbons instead of a staircase. Metadata only; no collision change.
      Non-grassy zones get a road too, but NOT these pieces: the kit's road tiles are dirt tracks
      drawn ON GRASS, so one in a dungeon lays a lawn in it. Those themes name a `road` surface in
      THEME_GROUND (Floor_RedBrick / Floor_Brick, a shade off the zone's own floor) and the floor
      pass paves the tagged cells with it.
      Verified by render in three zones: the Outskirts field (diagonal trails, road network at the
      river crossing), Black Woods (axis roads + autotiled corners, checked at eye level as well as
      from above) and the Ruined Keep (stone theme, `roadPaved` 2204 cells). Probe any zone with
      `__world3d().counts` — roadPlanned / roadTiles / roadPaved.
      ONE BUG WORTH REMEMBERING: the first Keep render reported roadPaved 0 with 47 tiles planned
      and logged nothing at all. THEME_GROUND named Floor_RedBrick but PROP_SETS never listed it,
      so it was never loaded and the road silently fell back to ordinary floor. A surface named in
      THEME_GROUND must also be in PROP_SETS; there is now a console.warn when it is not.)*
      *(progress 2026-08-01: the "not one uniform green" half is DONE, but not via a second grass
      tile. `THEME_GROUND[].tiles` now takes weighted variants, and every ground instance gets a
      deterministic brightness jitter (`GROUND_JITTER`) through `InstancedMesh.setColorAt`, so a
      field is mottled rather than one flat sheet — at no extra draw call. A second GRASS tile was
      built, rendered and REJECTED: the only candidate is castle/ground, and nature/ground_grass is
      flat teal with no texture while castle/ground is a textured mid-green, so any mix reads as
      discoloured blotches — 50/50 is a literal chessboard. Screenshots compared before dropping
      it. A real second grass variant needs an asset that is the same green with different detail;
      the repo has none (nature/ and terrain/ ship the identical file). The variant machinery IS
      used where the tiles match: ruins and apex mix Floor_Brick with Floor_UnevenBrick and read
      as worn flagstone.*
- [x] **Zone floors for the other five zones.** Done 2026-08-01 — no new pack needed. The premise
      was slightly off: those zones DID get a floor, but every non-grass zone shared one tile,
      `castle/ground`, which is the Castle Kit's GRASS tile. It passed as neutral only because its
      colormap 404'd and it drew white. Now each `STAGES[].theme` names its own surface + tint via
      `THEME_GROUND` in world3d.js: frost/void/apex/marble/ruins/dungeon on `village/Floor_Brick`,
      volcano/canyon/badlands on `village/Floor_UnevenBrick`, plains/forest still on grass.
      Also fixed the plumbing this depended on: `__BF_WORLD()` read `G.s.ground`, but `G.s` does
      not exist — the live stage is `STAGES[G.stageIndex]` — so the tint fell back to the olive
      default in EVERY zone, and world3d had no theme at all (it was testing theme names like
      'forest'/'plains' against ZONE ids, which never match). All 8 zones rendered and eyeballed.
      *Still approximations:* there is no true SNOW or MARBLE asset in the repo — Frostfell and the
      Sunspire are tinted stone. They read correctly, but a snow/marble pack would beat them.

## Class-unlock tier ladder (deeper secret = slightly stronger class)
Oliver will fine-tune power via playtesting, so build classes deliberately CLOSE in power (nudge numbers, not whole kits):
| Secret zone (region · stage) | Class | Core | Tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| Black Woods / Hollow (~1–3) | Ninja | Ranger | 1 |
| Ruined Keep (ruins · 5) | Pirate | Ranger | 2 |
| Frostfell (frost · 7) | Chronomancer | Mage | 3 |
| Abyss Approach (void · 11) | Reaper *(done)* | — | 4 |
| Sunspire Palace (marble · 13) | Paladin *(done)* | Warrior | 5 |
| Castle Duskmoor (apex · 15) | Necromancer *(done)* | Mage | 6 (deepest/strongest) |

## Kit textures — fixed 2026-08-01, and the one gap left
Every Kenney-style kit ships a `colormap.png` palette that its models index by UV. Three kits
could not find theirs, so 27 castle models, both hub floors and every brick floor rendered as
flat white. That is the real cause of the "these tiles carry no texture, only a material colour"
note that survived five sessions of hub-floor attempts — `map` was NONE because the file 404'd.

Fixed: `castle/colormap.png` copied to `castle/Textures/colormap.png` (where its 27 models look
for it), and `T_Brick/T_RedBrick/T_UnevenBrick_BaseColor.png` copied from `village/` into
`nature/` (the `Floor_*.gltf` in both kits are byte-identical files).

**Still missing, needs Oliver:** `town/Textures/colormap.png` — the town kit (fountain, cart,
stall, hedge, lantern, fence, banners, pillars = 15 models) has no palette anywhere in the repo.
Each kit's palette has a DIFFERENT column order, so castle's or props' cannot be substituted
without recolouring every model wrongly. Re-download the town kit or drop the palette in; do not
fake it. Until then those props render white and are held together by explicit tints in world3d.

Audit any time with `node _shot/shot.js --assets all` — lists every texture each kit references
and whether it is on disk. Remaining MISSING entries there are Normal/ORM/Roughness detail maps
only; those degrade shading slightly and never cause the white-model failure.

## Notes / open decisions (do NOT act on without Oliver)
- Elemental affixes on **physical** weapon drops (making "a Flaming Sword") is a separate system change — Oliver decides before building.
- Real icon art (class icons, skill/passive icons) is a supervised ChatGPT-in-Chrome pass — autopilot uses placeholders. **Necromancer currently has placeholder icons and needs its own 18-icon pass** — this is BLOCKED on Oliver (needs his ChatGPT tab); do not attempt it autonomously, skip to the next actionable item.
- No dragons in the game, so **no Dragonslayer class.**
